# Explanation of the files 

## bluetooth_hand

This folder contains an .ino file, which is used to control five servo motors via an application. There is also an .apk file, which is the application. 

## ML

This folder contains a web application to control five servomotors using an AI model. I have made the model in Teachable Machine, from google. This model uses your computer's camera. 

To open the web application follow these steps: 

1. Download the repository. 

2. Run te cmd. 

3. Search for the cd of the repository. In my case: "cd desktop/osde/arduino/ML/ML/ML_MODEL".

4. Host a server on your computer using python: "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"

5. Paste the following link in your browser: "http://localhost:8000/"
